# Hive Clients

An Ethereum Hive client refers to the use of the Hive testing framework in the context of Ethereum. Hive is a system for running integration tests or simulations to test client logic and behavior under specific conditions. It is designed to validate that Ethereum clients conform to baseline quality and can interact properly in a multi-client environment. 

## Clients

Currently we only have a single client `polard`.
