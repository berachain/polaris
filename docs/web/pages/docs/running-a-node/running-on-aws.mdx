## Running a Polaris VM Cosmos-SDK Chain on AWS

The recommended way to run fault tolerant nodes that can scale to millions of requests per second would be
with orchestration tool like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/). Another option is to run the node on an [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/ec2/) instance.

AWS offers [Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) which is a manged service to run Kubernetes in the cloud
It allows us to run lightweight pods in which you can deploy container images. On a failure, a new container automatically comes up. Each pod
can also be attached to a volume that can provide elastic disk storage. It also allows us to scale horizontally by adding more nodes/pods/containers on demand to the network.

<div className="steps-container">

## Example EKS architecture

Currently, the application runs in 1 container so we can deploy 1 container in each pod. Pod is the smallest resource that
Kubernetes can manage. It can have 1 or more than 1 containers.

Before we can set up pods, we need to set up our EKS cluster -

### Install AWS CLI and configure AWS Credentials

1. Install AWS CLI for your local machine from [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

2. Configure CLI credentials from [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)

3. Verify credentials and installation

   ```sh
   aws sts get-caller-identity
   ```

   It should return the following -

   ```sh
   {
   "Account": "123456789012",
   "UserId": "AR#####:#####",
   "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/role-name/role-session-name"
   }
   ```

### Install eksctl and kubectl

`eksctl` allows us to manage our EKS cluster and `kubectl` allows us to manage kubernetes resources.

1. Install `eksctl` from [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eksctl.html)

2. Verify installation

   ```sh
   eksctl version
   ```

3. Install `kubectl` from [docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

4. Verify installation

   ```sh
   kubectl version
   ```

### Set up EKS cluster

EKS is a managed Kubernetes cluster and AWS will manage our nodes for us. Clusters can also have controllers/add-ons
that help control and incorporate cloud specific resources

1. We can create a sample cluster by using following command -

   `eksctl create cluster --name my-cluster --region region-code`

   Note: you need to provide a cluster name and AWS region (Ex. `us-west-2`)

   This will create managed default AWS nodes for you to deploy your workloads. You can change the type of workload as well. ekstcl will also create a kubectl config file at `~/.kube`

2. Setup AWS load balancer controller from [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/aws-load-balancer-controller.html). This will help kubernetes manage our AWS load balancer.

### View Kubernetes resources

1. View your cluster nodes (which were deployed by eksctl)

   `kubectl get nodes -o wide`

   The response will be as follows -

   ```
   NAME                                           STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION                INTERNAL-IP      EXTERNAL-IP      OS-IMAGE         KERNEL-VERSION                  CONTAINER-RUNTIME
   ip-192-168-3-224.us-west-2.compute.internal    Ready    <none>   45h   v1.24.10-eks-48e63af   192.168.3.224    192.168.3.224    Amazon Linux 2   5.10.165-143.735.amzn2.x86_64   containerd://1.6.6
   ip-192-168-36-235.us-west-2.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   45h   v1.24.10-eks-48e63af   192.168.36.235   192.168.36.235    Amazon Linux 2   5.10.165-143.735.amzn2.x86_64   containerd://1.6.6
   ```

### Create kubernetes resources

    Kubernetes allows us to deploy a few types of `workloads` and `services`. Workloads control the pods and Services control the access to the pod.
    For our simple case, we will use workload of type `Deployment` and service of type `LoadBalancer`. Our container is deployed inside the pod.
    More information can be found in [docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/)

1. Setup namespace

   Namespaces ensure that we can use the same cluster to deploy multiple types of applications. We will create a namespace `testnet` for our chain

   ```sh
   kubectl create namespace testnet
   ```

1. Create Deployment

For our deployment, we would create a `deployment.yaml `file which looks something like this --

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
    name: node
    namespace: testnet
    spec:
    replicas: 1
    selector:
        matchLabels:
        app: node
    template:
        metadata:
        labels:
            app: node
        spec:
        containers:
            - name: node
            image: <container-registry>/<container-image>
            ports:
                - name: apphttp
                containerPort: 1317
                - name: tendermintgrpc
                containerPort: 9090
                - name: tendermintrpc
                containerPort: 26657
                - name: tendermintpp
                containerPort: 26656

    ```
    We are creating a pod with 1 replica and it has 1 container. The container is created using the image tag.

    For more information on `deployments`, refer to this [doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)

2. Create Service

For our service, as we want our node to be access from the public internet, we will create it as a `LoadBalancer`. It will create an AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB)

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
    name: node-nlb
    namespace: testnet
    annotations:
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: external
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-nlb-target-type: ip
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: internet-facing
    spec:
    ports:
        - name: apphttp
        port: 80
        targetPort: 1317
        protocol: TCP
        - name: tenderpmintrpc
        port: 26657
        targetPort: 26657
        protocol: TCP
        - name: tendermintpp
        port: 26656
        targetPort: 26656
        protocol: TCP
        - name: tendermintgrpc
        port: 9090
        targetPort: 9090
        protocol: TCP
    type: LoadBalancer
    selector:
        app: node
    ```
    We are creating a service of type `LoadBalancer`. This will create a public load balancer and will route requests received on port `80`
    to port `1317` where we are running our JSON RPC server.

3. Verify workload and service

   We should validate that the resources are set up as expected. You can verify running pods by following -

   ```sh
   kubectl get pods -n testnet -o wide
   ```

   The expected status should be `RUNNING` for the pod

   You can verify that the service is running by following -

   ```sh
   kubectl get services -n testnet
   ```

   You should also verify in AWS console if the Network Load Balancer has been provisioned

4. Test RPC endpoints

   You can test the public rpc endpoint by getting the NLB URL

   ```sh
   curl -X POST <load_balancer_url>/eth/rpc -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method":"eth_blockNumber", "params":[], "id":1}'
   ```
