## Running a Polaris Cosmos-SDK with Docker

### From docker container artifactory

The easiest way to run the node in a docker container is to use a pre-built container image. You can find the images in the [container regsitry]() (Coming Soon).

### From container image

1. Install Docker on your machine from the [official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

   Verify it's installed

   ```sh
   docker version
   ```

   If not installed, verify that the path is set correctly and docker daemon is running in background

2. Pull the docker image

   You can point to the release image. Referring to `latest` in this case

   ```sh
   docker image pull <polaris-container-registry>/polaris:latest>
   ```

   Note: Might have to use different docker image for different OS

3. Run the container image

   ```sh
   docker run -p 1317:1317 <polaris-container-registry>/polaris:latest>
   ```

Now you have a node running on your machine with a default chain and we have RPC running on port `1317` and path `eth/rpc`. To verify,
you can try `eth_blockNumber` JSON-RPC example below -

```sh
curl -X POST 127.0.0.1:1317/eth/rpc -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method":"eth_blockNumber", "params":[], "id":1}'
```

A successful JSON RPC query will return in following -

```sh
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "result": "<block_number>"
}
```
