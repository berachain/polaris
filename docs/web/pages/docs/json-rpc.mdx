# Polaris Ethereum JSON-RPC

The Polaris Ethereum API is accessible through JSON-RPC, a lightweight protocol for 
transmitting data over the internet. This protocol enables developers to 
interact with the Polaris Ethereum blockchain and access a wide range of 
functionalities through a simple and standardized interface.

Through the Polaris Ethereum JSON-RPC endpoint, developers can access a variety of 
methods to create, modify, and interact with smart contracts, as well as 
retrieve blockchain data and monitor blockchain events in real-time.
