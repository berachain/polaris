# Available Tools

There are a number of available tools for frontend dApp developers building on Polaris. Being an
EVM compatible chain, it's tool set is interoperable with the broader EVM ecosystem.
Here are a few of the tools available for Polaris:

### Wagmi.sh
[wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) is a collection of hooks and helpers for 
rapidly developing evm frontend dApps. It provides out of the box wallet connection,
data caching, and persistence.

### Web3React & Ethers.js
[Web3React](https://github.com/Uniswap/web3-react) is a lightweight framework for creating Ethereum dApps with React. It provides a simple interface
for connecting to Ethereum wallets as well as some useful hooks for managing providers and accounts.
When combined with [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/), It provides a highly customizable tool set for building lightweight dApps.

## Examples

To highlight the improved user experience Polaris' [Stateful Precompiles](../precompile-overview)
provide when interacting with cosmos modules, we have created a simple example
staking dApp that shows developers the simplicity this technology provides.
