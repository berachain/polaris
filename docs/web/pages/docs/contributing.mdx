# Contributing

Stargazer welcomes contributions to its source code from anyone in the community, 
no matter how small the fix or upgrade may be. If you're interested in contributing, 
you can start by forking the [GitHub repository], making your fix or improvement, 
committing the changes, and then submitting a pull request for the maintainers 
to review and merge into the main code base. However, if you plan on submitting 
more complex changes, it's recommended to check in with the core developers on 
the [Stargazer Github Issues] first to ensure that your changes align with the project's 
philosophy and to get some early feedback that can make the review and merge process 
smoother for both parties.

It's important that your contributions adhere to Stargazer's coding guidelines, which 
include:
- Following the official Go formatting and commentary guidelines, 
- Basing pull requests on the `main` branch,
- Using appropriate commit message prefixes. 

All pull requests will be reviewed based on the Stargazer's code review guidelines.

Stargazer also encourages an early pull request approach, where contributors create pull 
requests as early as possible, even if the fix or feature is not yet completed. 
This approach lets core developers and other volunteers know that someone is 
working on the issue and allows for more collaborative and efficient development. 
These early pull requests should indicate that they are "in progress".
