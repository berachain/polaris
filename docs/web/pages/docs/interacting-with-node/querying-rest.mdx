# Interacting With Polaris via REST

Polaris extends the base functionality of the Cosmos-SDK for querying via REST.
To learn more about querying the node via REST, see [here](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/run-node/interact-node#using-the-rest-endpoints).

## Swagger Open API Specification

Polaris supports the Swagger API, which is a specification for describing RESTful APIs.
The Swagger API is available at the following endpoints

|Network   |Swagger Url   |
|----------|-------------:|
|Local Node     |   `Coming Soon`|
|Testnet        |   `Coming Soon`|
|Mainnet        |   `Coming Soon`|

### Base Cosmos-SDK Open API Specification
