  Polaris Ethereum CLI will work the same way as Cosmos SDK. Replace `simd` with `polard`
</Callout>

Polaris Ethereum does not extend the base implementation of transaction handling in the Cosmos SDK.
For information on handling transactions in Polaris Ethereum you can reference [Generating, Signing and Broadcasting Transactions
](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.47/run-node/txs) 
from the Cosmos SDK documentation.
