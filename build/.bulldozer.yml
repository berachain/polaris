# "version" is the configuration version, currently "1".
version: 1

# "merge" defines how and when pull requests are merged. If the section is
# missing, bulldozer will consider all pull requests and use default settings.
merge:
  # "trigger" defines the set of pull requests considered by bulldozer. If
  # the section is missing, bulldozer considers all pull requests not excluded
  # by the ignore conditions.
  trigger:
    # Pull requests with any of these labels (case-insensitive) are added to
    # the trigger.
    labels: ["Automerge", "Merge me daddy"]

    # Pull requests with auto merge enabled are added to the trigger.
    auto_merge: true

  # "required_statuses" is a list of additional status contexts that must pass
  # before bulldozer can merge a pull request. This is useful if you want to
  # require extra testing for automated merges, but not for manual merges.
  required_statuses:
    - "ci/circleci: lint"
    - "ci/circleci: test-unit"
    - "ci/circleci: test-unit-race"

  # "ignore" defines the set of pull request ignored by bulldozer. If the
  # section is missing, bulldozer considers all pull requests. It takes the
  # same keys as the "trigger" section.
  ignore:
    labels: ["Do not merge"]
    comment_substrings: ["==DO_NOT_MERGE=="]

  # "method" defines the merge method. The available options are "merge",

  # If true, bulldozer will merge pull requests with no required checks. This
